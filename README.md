##bomb
Bomb is a simple game on java.I used what I have learned now to write it which is just similar to the Minesweeper Flags installed in window.

##Getting start
    ./cd src
    ./javac bombgame.java
    ./java bombgame
(If you can't run the javac,install the Java Development Kit and set the enviroment.)
It will pop out a window that you can enter row and  column.Then press play and it will pop out another window to start your game.
